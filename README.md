# Health dashboard

## Information

This repo contains code for creating a health dashboard with data from the Strava v3 API as the main data source.

For making the API request to Strava, code in Python and C# is available.

### Strava v3 API

To use the Strava v3 API, you must perform two steps:

1. Set up your Strava application
2. Use information in your Strava application to perform the API request

Do a search on Medium to find articles who describe the process in detail, there are several articles available.

## Code

Both the Python and C# code perform the exact same operation, just in two different languages.

### Python

Currently complete, but lacks better error handling in some scripts and a main.py script for orchestration. Now, all scripts must be manually run in sequence.

### Csharp

Currently complete, but data is not stored in dedicated folder.
